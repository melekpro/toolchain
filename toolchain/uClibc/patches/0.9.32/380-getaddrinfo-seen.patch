Subject: getaddrinfo(): avoid call to __check_pf() when not needed

__check_pf() function is called from getaddrinfo() and it calls
getifaddrs(), which is too much overhead especially if RSBAC-Net
is enabled. So with this patch __check_pf() is being called only
when AI_ADDRCONFIG hint flag is specified - just when we really
need that check.
